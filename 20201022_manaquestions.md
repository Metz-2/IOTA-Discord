# Community Mana what ifs...


* If this is correct (https://thetangle.org/statistics/tokens-distribution) about 0.07% of addresses hold ~70% of all tokens. This means that even if 99.93% of addresses contribute towards active, honest mana, that's only ~30% of total mana.  How 0.07% of addresses controlling 70% of tokens is not a problem at all (for consensus, or voting, or data throughput, etc) (given the token )

* What's the percentage of (active/passive) Mana held by honest node owners required to prevent artificial network saturation in order to prevent the emergence of a market of fee-based transactions, assuming that malicious node owners might saturate the network artificially ("spam") in order to be able to sell their network capacity (to the highest bidder)
* Is it possible to approve double spends by approving two conflicting transactions and embedding them into the tangle if there are enough malicious node owners "approving" them? What's the percentage of (active/passive) Mana that would be required to successfully do this? How would honest nodes react to relayed, yet conflicting transactions a majority of malicious (node ownrs/Mana holders) has voted to be legitimate
