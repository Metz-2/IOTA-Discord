## How should a suggestion look like?

Here the preferred standard format to add suggestions:

- Add a new file in the `channelsDescriptions` directory and use the channel name as filename followed by `.md` e.g. `iota-academy.md`
- As content insert the description you'd like
- Add also helpful links (full links only, no shorteners)
- In the end add your Discord handle for the credits
- Add a `|` at the end of every line, besides the `Credits` line.

The description has a limit of **1024 characters** and supports the default Discord emojis e.g.`:grin:`
