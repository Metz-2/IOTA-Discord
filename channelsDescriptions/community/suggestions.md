# IOTA Discord Channel description

Please use this document to suggest changes in the IOTA Discord channel descriptions.

## How should a suggestion look like?

Here the preferred standard format to add suggestions to this document:

- In the first line insert the **channel name** with three # symbols you would like to add a suggestion to
- Insert the description you'd like
- Add also helpful links (full links only, no shorteners)
- In the end add your Discord handle for the credits (**OPTIONAL**)
- Add a `|` at the end of every line, besides the `Credits` line

The description has a limit of **1024 characters** and supports the default Discord emojis e.g.`:grin:`

Here the example
```
