* Community members: Please discuss the proposal together in the `#experience` channel



## Custom Commands start here  

### !focus

IOTA is fundamentally not about the market cap. Currently, virtually all posts in here are about the price or exchanges, this is not what this subreddit is for. This subreddit is for the IOTA project, not the IOTA price, we have /r/iotamarkets and /r/cryptomarkets for that. The thing that made IOTA great in the first place is its insistence on focusing on actual progress and the cutting edge technology that it is. I want more brainstorming about use cases, see more meetups arranged, more discussions about the technology itself, the different modules etc. https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7hxfgx/focus/

### !warn-scam

⚠️ Reminder: don’t trust anyone asking for your seed, even if they claim they’re IOTA Foundation members. Please report these scammers to one of the admins. ⚠️

### !nodeinsync

Sometimes a host node will fall out of sync and wallets may not appear to be showing the proper information. Double check if the two numbers in the bottom left corner of your wallet are identical (or off by 1-2). Also double check the two numbers are at or near the latest milestone displayed in the #botbox channel. If they're not, change your host node through Tools - Edit Node Configuration. You can check public node health at http://iota.dance/nodes and http://iotanode.host/

### !stolen

Do you see an unauthorized outgoing transaction in your wallet? You have likely used malicious online seed generators when generating your seed. If the stolen transaction is still pending (it'll say "Pending" underneath the transaction in your wallet history), URGENTLY send your entire balance to an address in a different seed.

### !chart

### !spec

You can join the {#speculation} channel by going to the {#rank-yourself} channel and typing `!rank speculation`

### !theway

If you've received a transaction with the message "Do you know the way?" or any other message this isn't anything malicious but just regular harmless spam. The Tangle and addresses containing IOTA tokens are publicly available for everyone, anyone willing to spend some resources on sending transactions can do this. Again, this is harmless and you can just ignore it.

### !migration

### !nobalance

If you have no balance in Trinity but did do the migration during the seed migration period make sure you create a new account and import your new seedvault, provided by the migration tool, as the existing seed. If you have no history at all for your account in Trinity you probably mistyped your seed, please enter it again and double check. If you see a outgoing value transaction in Trinity that you did not make feel free to contact someone from the IOTA Foundation through DM here. ** Beware: Always start the DM yourself, don't trust others DM-ing you, they might be a impersonator. Never give away your seed, ledger recovery phrase or personal information to anyone over DM**.

### !hornetissue

In order to foster the development of HORNET, it is necessary to collect issues/feature requests in one place: GitHub. If you run into issues or have feature requests, please open an issue on the HORNET GitHub issue page (https://github.com/gohornet/hornet/issues). Reporting crashes or other problems solely on Discord doesn't allow us to prioritize or correctly manage them. When creating an issue on GitHub, please append as much of the log, your particular configuration and other details to the issue, to help us resolving it.

### !houserules

### !specrules

```
- No racism, sexism, homophobia, or other hate speech
- No insults or personal attacks
- No persistent repetition (whether positive or negative)
- No unsubstantiated arguments

Ignore these rules and you will be muted or banned.```
```

### !faq

Have a look at the Firefly/Migration FAQs here
https://firefly.iota.org/faq

### !trinity-migration

Check in trinity if your funds are out and sent to an address starting with "TRANSFER..." Check this transaction here <https://explorer.iota.org/legacy-mainnet> - if it is confirmed, your balance is correct and you have a backup of the 24 words and your stronghold file. You can close Firefly, the migration was successful.
