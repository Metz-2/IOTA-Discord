List of rules for the membership screening functionality in Discord
![Discord Membership Screening](/_resources/images/membership_screening.png)


:rotating_light: **NEVER EVER give away your IOTA Seed or Ledger Nano Recovery Phrase to anyone**. Not even if this person pretends to be from the IOTA Foundation.   

**Disrespectful language or inappropriate emoji responses won't be tolerated**. Please be respectful to one another, regardless of what is being said.

**This server is intended as a family friendly server** where anyone with an interest in IOTA can contribute, regardless of age. Please refrain from posting material that isn't deemed family friendly.  

**Keep coin price discussions in #speculation**. This server is about technology, not coin prices. 

**Advertising in this server is not allowed**. Explicit permission has been granted by someone from the IOTA Foundation.  

Please **keep the discussions on-topic **based on the channel you are in. Off-topic talk is allowed in the #casual channel as long as it's respectful, family friendly, no advertisement, not about religion/politics and not about coin prices.  

**Trolls are not welcome**. Please refrain from meming, repeating the same argument over and over again and causing drama.  

**Do not ping IOTA Foundation members** unless they are actively engaging at that point in time in the channel you are in. To talk to someone from the IOTA Foundation feel free to contact one of the Community managers/liaisons instead (Antonio Nardella, Mark Schmidt or Dave de Fijter)  

:rotating_light: **Scammers will try to contact you via DM**. While we have safety protocols in place, it is a public server and fake accounts can find their way to the sever. 

:rotating_light: **Don't trust someone from the IOTA Foundation or a known moderator/community member that DM's you**. If you need to send a DM always initiate it yourself through the user menu in this server in order to avoid being DM-ed by a imposter.  

:rotating_light: **We NEVER ask you to transfer or exchange funds**. Don't trust anyone DM-ing you with a similar request and notify the moderators if this happens.  

:rotating_light: **Don't use websites or external services to generate seeds**. Always use a safe method, for example by using the official IOTA wallet.  

:rotating_light: **Only download software from the original sources of the IOTA Foundation**. Don't trust direct links but always find the software you need on https://www.iota.org/, for Trinity always use https://trinity.iota.org/  

:rotating_light: **Imposters use very convincing, almost identically looking usernames and avatars**. If you don't trust it ask for help in this server!  

By being in this server you will comply to the **Discord Terms of Service**.  

Please contact one of our moderators if you have any issues with another user of this Discord.
Public feedback on moderation decisions is not allowed, please DM the person in question if you have any questions about any action taken.
