# Rules
List of rules for the membership screening functionality in Discord


Please **be respectful** to one another, regardless of what is being said. Disrespectful language or inappropriate emoji responses won't be tolerated.  

This server is intended as a **family friendly server** where anyone with an interest in IOTA can contribute, regardless of age. Please refrain from posting material that isn't deemed **family friendly**.  

This server is about **technology**, not coin prices. **Keep coin price discussions in** #speculation  

**Advertising** in this server is **not allowed** unless explicit permission has been granted by someone from the IOTA Foundation.  

Please **keep the discussions on-topic **based on the channel you are in. Off-topic talk is allowed in the #casual channel as long as it's respectful, family friendly, no advertisement, not about religion/politics and not about coin prices.  

**Trolls are not welcome**, please refrain from meming, repeating the same argument over and over again and causing drama.  

Please do **not ping IOTA Foundation members** unless they are actively engaging at that point in time in the channel you are in. To talk to someone from the IOTA Foundation feel free to contact one of the Community managers/liaisons instead (Antonio Nardella, Mark Schmidt or Dave de Fijter)  

Please contact one of our moderators if you have any issues with another user of this Discord.  

Public feedback on moderation decisisons is not allowed, please DM the person in question if you have any questions about any action taken.  

By being in this server you will comply to the **Discord Terms of Service**.  

:rotating_light: **NEVER EVER give away your IOTA Seed or Ledger Nano Recovery Phrase** to anyone. Not even if this person pretends to be from the IOTA Foundation.  

:rotating_light: **Don't trust** someone from the IOTA Foundation or a known moderator/community member that DM's you. If you need to send a DM always initiate it yourself through the user menu in this server in order to avoid being DM-ed by a imposter.  

:rotating_light: **We NEVER ask you to transfer or exchange funds** for us, don't trust anyone DM-ing you with a similar request and notify the moderators if this happens.  

:rotating_light: **Don't use websites or external services to generate seeds**, always use a safe method, for example by using the official IOTA wallet.  

:rotating_light: Only **download software from the original sources** of the IOTA Foundation, don't trust direct links but always find the software you need on https://www.iota.org/, for Trinity always use https://trinity.iota.org/  

:rotating_light: Imposters use very convincing, almost identically looking usernames and avatars. If you don't trust it **ask for help** in this server!
